# LargeClockforVI
This project contains a java desktop app that contains a clock with large text to keep floating on desktop for the Visually impaired.
I am partialy blind, and like to keep this clock floating arround becuase its hard to see the clock in the system trey.
This is just a quick and dirty solution to that problem.
To run this file make sure you have java installed, and a IDE if you want to tinker with the code.
To run the code just go to the dist folder and run the jar file to execute. 
NOTE: If you seperate the Jar file from the rest of the folder the jar file may not work properly.
